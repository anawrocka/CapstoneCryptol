\chapter{AES in Cryptol}\label{app:aes}

In this appendix we present the Cryptol code for the AES\indAES in its
entirety for reference purposes.  Chapter~\ref{chapter:aes} has a
detailed discussion on how AES works, and the construction of the
Cryptol model below.

In the below code, simply set {\tt Nk} to be 4 for AES128, 6 for
AES192, and 8 for AES256 on line 15. No other modifications are
required for obtaining these AES variants. Note that we have
rearranged the code given in Chapter~\ref{chapter:aes} below for ease
of reading.
%%  and eliminated the theorem declarations for simplicity.
